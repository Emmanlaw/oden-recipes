    <h3>Ingredeints</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>2 (1 &#189; pound) pork tenderloins</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon kosher salt, or to taste</li>
        <li>&#189; teaspoon freshly ground balck pepper, or to taste</li>
        <li>2 tablespoon olive oil</li>
        <li>2 shallots, thinly sliced lengthwise</li>
        <li>12 fresh figs, stemmed and halved</li>
        <li>1 cupp chicken broth</li>
        <li>&frac14; cup good-quality balsamic vinegar</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon minced fresh</li>
        <li>fesh rosemary springs for garnish (optional)</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Pat tenderloins dry and remove silver skin, if present. Season with kosher salt and freshly ground pepper, to taste.</li>
        <li>Pour oil into a large, oven-proof skillet and heat over medium-heat until oil shimmers. Carefully place seasoned tenderloins into the hot oil and brown on all sides, 7 to 10 minutes total.</li>
        <li>Add sliced shallots around tenderloins and stir, about 1 minute. Add figs, chicken broth, and balsamic vinegar. When the mixture begins to bubble, sprinkle minced rosemary over everthing.</li>
        <li>Cover, place in the preheated oven and bake until pork is no longer pink in the center, 25 to 30 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read 145 degrees F (63 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Using tongs, remove pork from the skillet and place on a serving platter. With a slotted spoon, remove figs from the skillet and place around the tenderloins. Cover loosely with foil.</li>
        <li>Place skillet back onto the stovetop over medium-high heat. Bring pan juices to a boil and allow to reduce to about 3/4 cup, 10 to 15 minutes.</li>
        <li>Slice tenderloins, drizzle reduced liquid over the meat, and garnish with fresh rosemary sprigs, if desired.</li>
    </ol>
